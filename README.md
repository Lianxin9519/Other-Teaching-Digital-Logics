# Other-Teaching-Digital-Logics
README:

  This circuit design will count and display the numbers 00 to 99 and then repeat.  It is based on the project of designing a circuit that will count and display numbers from 0 to 9 for students in a digital logic class. 

  The components we gave students included 555 timers, 7490 ICs (74LS90), 7447 ICs (74LS47), one digit 7-Segment Displays, Resistors (100k, 47k, and 1k), Capacitors (0.1, 2.2).

  The schematic is as follows:
